# server library

The host library is for web development and to see the preview of your website. <br>
I dont know everything about localhost and might be used for more functionality <br>

how: It will create a .html file and a file named "server.js" <br>
the .html file will be written by the user with the "$ws" keyword, <br>
```js
  const s = xtralib("host")
  s.$ws("<!-- content -->")
```
and to create a localhost use the "$()" keyword

```js
  const s = xtralib("host")
  s.$("filename", 69) // the numbers is your hosting number
```
